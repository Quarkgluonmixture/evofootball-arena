# Roadmap — shipped through phase-40 + 36.1; play-report iteration is live

**Audience: the next coding agent (and the user).** Everything through
**phase-40** is SHIPPED and live — the 2026-07-13 autonomous run
delivered the whole realism-gap plan (35 game-state tactics, 36 visible
touches, 37 Magnus, 38 body contact) plus 39 traits and 40 ecology, each
with probe evidence, and a bit-identical structure pass. ⭐ **RESUME
HERE: there is NO queued build work — the next phase comes from the
user's PLAY REPORTS (the awaiting list below) or a new user pick from
the parking lot.** Phase specs are directions, not
commitments: re-scope each against the user's play reports before
starting. When play-feel and the calibrate table disagree, **the user's
play report wins**. Awaiting play reports on: 40 ecology (does 🔥
Derby! land; rivalry list + ★ prestige on cards), 39 traits (do the
emoji chips + captain read; do 🦊 post-channel runs show), 38 body
contact (shield / shoulder ride / corner grapple — do the poses READ
on the phone), 37
Magnus (the corner whip, the FK banana, curled finishes), 36 visible
touches (does
the carry finally read as FEET, poke steals, heavy-touch feel), 35
game-state tactics (late-chase feel, 门将上前, bus/clock-milking, the
live gene bars breathing), 34 套路包 (one-twos/third-man/overlap
visibility + the stats rows), 34.2/34.3 (set keeper, 脱压带球, turn
tax/hold-up feel), formation-ecology monoculture watch (34's sharper
selection), box duels still ~7:1 defender-won (dials listed at 31.9). The 32 danger-band
whistle report is PARTLY addressed by 35 (set pieces + balls in flight
are never whistled away now — open-play buildup at patience-over still
gets cut, by design).

Standing rules (full detail in [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md) §10–13):
**every phase ends with PROBE evidence** (user rule 2026-07-13, invariant
11: a `scripts/probes/` tsx measuring the mechanic's own rate/shape —
same-seed A/B vs the previous tag for "X improved" claims, two calibrate
seeds before believing deltas, headless choreography probes for
render-side logic, strip-and-rehash for schema growth);
every step ends with typecheck + full vitest + both Playwright suites green;
push via `gh auth switch --user Quarkgluonmixture`, then switch back; verify
the Pages bundle after CI; itch.io needs a manual `npm run package:itch`;
re-baseline the determinism fingerprint after mechanics changes;
**calibrate noise on goals is ±0.3–0.4 at the default n=142 — ALWAYS
measure balance levers with `npm run calibrate -- 8` (n=568), and read
failure modes 16–21 before touching any lever** (18 is Phase 30's whole
detective story: goals live in gene-mix variance, LESS marking = STRONGER
defence, structure deleted the goals-above-xG channel; 19–21 are Phase
30.5/31's: bounded support fans, the completion homeostat, and
inheritance compounding — plus fm 12's Node-vs-Node corollary for any
long-run league test); statistical
match-loop tests need `{ timeout }` + `setImmediate` yields every ~25
matches or CI's 2-core runner starves vitest's heartbeat; Playwright
selectors are English (suites pin `lang=en`); the user plays 3D on a
PHONE (≤390–640px) — check every UI change there; sim-generated text
stays English (sim/ never touches the browser), UI chrome is localized
via `src/ui/i18n.ts` (zh default).

---

## ⭐ Phase 30 — 6v6 + the formation system — **SHIPPED (tag `phase-30`)**

**Outcome:** all four steps built and gated (202 tests, 51+32 visual
checks). Texture targets hit: tackles+interceptions 76.7 → ~57, completion
63%, ~21 through balls, build-up visible, keeper distributions find set
receivers. **Goals landed at ~1.4, honestly below the 2.6–3.0 target** —
the structures deleted the chaos goals and set shapes suppress chance
volume for everyone; ARCHITECTURE **failure mode 18** is the full analysis
(variance insight, zonal-is-OP paradox, n=142 noise is ±0.3–0.4 → use
`npm run calibrate -- 8`). Corner threat collapsed to ~3% (the one
hardcoded cross died to set shapes) — **Phase 31's corner routines are
promoted from polish to fix.** The user's first 6v6 play reports decide
the rebalance before any new build.

<details><summary>Original handover plan (done — kept for reference)</summary>

**The user's diagnosis (verbatim in spirit):** most possessions die in
midfield scrambles or backfield steals, keeper distributions gift
breakaways, no tiki-taka and no wing play, and everything still clumps.
The root: 4 outfielders on a 90×58 pitch with NO build-up structure.

### Scope

- **6th player = a SECOND WINGER** (两翼齐飞 — width was the most-missed
  behavior). Slot order `[GK, DF, MF, WGL, WGR, ST]`.
- **Formation system**: every team owns a FIXED attacking formation AND
  defending formation (identity, shown on the team card, inherited through
  rebirth) picked from a small library of per-slot spot tables (e.g.
  attack `wide-212` vs `narrow-122`; defend `low-32` vs `press-23`).
  `formationSpot` reads the team's tables instead of the one global
  `BASE_SPOTS`. Per-team defensive SCHEME: **man-marking vs zonal** (zonal
  = hold sliding spots, man = current `assignMarks` behavior). Derive
  scheme + formation picks deterministically from the genome at franchise
  creation (no genome/save migration for this part), store on `TeamInfo`,
  inherit on rebirth.
- **The keeper WAITS for shape** (kills the distribution gifts): a goal
  kick / hold release does not happen until teammates settle near their
  attacking-formation spots (determinism-safe timeout ~4s); receivers are
  SET before the ball comes; keeper-throw target gates get stricter.
  Expected: build-up exists, midfield scrambles drop, no more
  "门将开球失误送单刀".

### Implementation order (the handover steps)

0. **Wildcard removal** — DONE (`phase-29.2`, commit `5c46abf`). Check
   `git log` before redoing anything. `PolicyParams` / `DEFAULT_POLICY` /
   `TeamInfo.policy+rolePolicies` plumbing was deliberately KEPT (it's the
   brain's tuning surface; bit-equivalence tests ride on it).
1. **6v6 mechanical pass — DONE (phase 30.1)**: full gate green (193 vitest,
   2D 51 + 3D 34 Playwright, fingerprint re-baselined
   `92f30f48…`). First 6v6 calibrate: 2.06 goals / 67% completion /
   1.99 offsides / tackles+interceptions 76.7 (the predicted pre-formation
   crowding bump — step 2's job). Original spec: add the 6th slot as
   a second WG; introduce a `TEAM_SIZE` constant and a slot-role list;
   grep-sweep EVERY 5-player assumption:
   - `% 5` (decision-tick stagger), `players[4]` / `for i 4..1` (kickoff
     striker pick), `* 5` / gid math (**gid = side·TEAM_SIZE + index**;
     `playerStats` and `allPlayers` are gid-indexed),
   - `slice(0, 5)`, `playerNames`/`squad`/`ages` array lengths,
     `names.ts` (6 surnames), role-biased newgen for the 2nd WG
     (`evolution/playerGenome.ts` — WG bias already exists, reuse),
   - save **v8** (chain-migrate in `data/save.ts`: backfill one generated
     WG newgen per team — old saves must keep playing; follow the v6/v7
     migration patterns and their tests),
   - team cards on PHONE widths (6 squad rows), 2D/3D labels, shootout
     lineup (best-of-5 from 6 players — `shootoutLineup` should already
     generalize; verify),
   - `RUN_ROLE_W` / `AERIAL_ROLE` / any `Record<Role, …>` tables still
     type-check (Role set unchanged — WG just appears twice).
   Then re-baseline the determinism fingerprint and fix the
   gid/position-hardcoded tests (aerial duel harness, onball scenarios,
   match bounds, offside `defence()` helper). **Gate green before step 2.**
2. **Formations**: the library (a `FORMATIONS` table in
   `src/ai/formations.ts`: `Record<FormationId, V2[]>` per slot, attack +
   defend variants), per-team picks + scheme (genome-derived via
   `hashSeed`, TeamInfo-stored, rebirth-inherited in
   `evolution/franchise.ts`), `formationSpot` reads team tables (the
   gene/mode modifiers — slide, depth, width, MODE_SHIFT — stay ON TOP of
   the table spot exactly as they sit on BASE_SPOTS today),
   `assignMarks` gets the zonal branch (zonal = keep sliding spots + only
   mark inside own box; man = current behavior), team card + right panel
   show formations + scheme (i18n: 阵型/盯人方案). Directional test: a
   `low-32` team concedes fewer shots than `press-23` vs the same
   opponent (side-balanced, pooled seeds §10.5).
3. **Keeper waits for shape**: goal-kick ready gate in `stepRestart`
   (extend the `ready` condition) + gk hold-release gate (extend
   `gkHoldTimer` decrement or the ThrowOut/pass decision gate) on
   "≥3 outfielders within ~6m of their attacking spots", timeout-capped
   (~4s, pure sim-state — invariant 3, watched ≡ skipped; NO wall clock).
   Test: from a forced goal kick, receivers' mean distance-to-spot at the
   moment of the kick is below the gate across seeds.
4. **Retune**: calibrate targets ~2.6–3.0 goals; **tackles+interceptions
   should FALL from ~66/match — that's the crowding number**; offsides ~2;
   completion should RISE toward ~70% (build-up exists again); README/ARCH
   stamps; tag `phase-30`; push; verify Pages; remind itch.

### Risks / watchpoints

- 6th body could WORSEN crowding if formations don't spread lanes — tune
  formation tables before touching AI weights.
- Offside line interacts with the 2nd WG (more legal outlets wide);
  re-check offside rate after step 2, not step 1.
- The keeper-waits gate must not deadlock: the timeout is the failsafe —
  test a pathological setup (all teammates sent off / parked far).

## ⭐ Phase 30.5 — the live-play texture pass — **SHIPPED**

**The user's first 6v6 play report** (2026-07-12): starts fine, then
degrades into a perpetual midfield scramble — constant dispossessions, a
pile of bodies, no visible formation, wings unused except by a few teams.
Their hypothesis: organizing attack pays too little, swarming pays too
much. Diagnosis confirmed in code, but the lever was GEOMETRY, not payoff
weights: all three off-ball supporters converged into one column ~10–18m
ahead of the carrier (dragging markers into the same corridor — every
forward lane walled), the tightest marking stance stood INSIDE tackle
radius (a marked reception = snap dispossession), loose balls pulled 2
chasers per team plus the crowd, 82% of through balls flew into blocked
lanes (the chip was judged by the kicker's surroundings, not the landing),
and the 2.15s floated switch always lost its aerial duel at the winger.

**Shipped fixes** (each measured at n=568): radius-bounded support fan
(failure mode 19 — the unbounded first cut inverted the 5v6 invariant),
marking stance floor 1.2m (slope 1.8 → 1.4; genes.test guards the
aggression payoff), loose ball = 1 chaser per team, landing-judged chips +
multiplicative openness gate on through balls, driven 1.4–1.6s switches.
**Result: goals 1.44 → 1.94, on-target 3.45 → 4.21 — the set-defence
era's first volume recovery — t+i ≈58 flat, completion pinned at ~61–63%
(failure mode 20: it's an evolutionary homeostat; don't chase it).**
New probes: `probe-pass.ts` (pass-failure buckets), `probe-shorthand.ts`
(5v6 sanity). Policy shot-skew test strengthened (shootBase 6) — the
lever works, the organized league prices it higher. Fingerprint
re-baselined `64039883…`. What only the user can judge: whether the
fan/wings/duels read as ORGANIZED on the pitch — the next play report
decides whether 30.5 iterates or Phase 31 starts.

---

## ⭐ Phase 31 — beating SET defences, set-piece routines, formation evolution — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome (final `calibrate -- 8`): goals 2.58 (target ≥2.2, stretch 2.6
hit), on-target 4.89 (≥4.5 ✓), completion 64% (≥62% ✓), t+i 55.7 (≤60 ✓),
corner→shot ~7-9% across league seeds (from 2-4%; the literal ≥8%-
everywhere needs marker-tracking separation — markers shadow crashers
frame-perfectly, so the goal-side man still wins most post duels; the
aerial.test floor sits at 0.04), crosses 1.35 (the ~2.5 reference was
pre-cutback: byline drives + cutbacks 0.46 + corner routines carry the
wide-delivery texture now; crossBase 0.32 was tried and overshot goals to
3.0), offsides 1.71 (the expected tick-up never came — fine).** All five
steps built: lane-aware shooting + explicit blocks (31.1, plus the
user-reported 单刀回传/大空间不突破 fixes — the OPEN RUN economy and the
REST-DEFENCE DF), byline cutbacks + the arriving runner + 下底 + far-post
pull (31.2), corner routines with the crasher-wait gate (31.3, plus
chasers capped at two — user report), formation evolution with the zonal
ecology budget (31.4 — failure mode 21: inheritance compounded zonal to
10/16 clubs before the budget), aimMargin 1.2 → 1.3 retune (31.5, fm 16a
re-validated: +0.36 goals from one aim-safety lever). 225 tests;
fingerprint re-baselined `3aed8c8f…`.

**Phase 31.6 — the post-ship live-play pass (SHIPPED same day):** four
user reports, four fixes. (1) "开门球对面挤着队员" → the distribution
STAND-OFF: while a keeper stands over a goal kick or holds the ball,
markers cover from 2.0–2.6m (aggression still scales it — a flat floor
erased the gene channel again, 30.5's lesson second edition). (2)
"offside 应该发门球" → offside now restarts as a GOAL KICK to the
defenders (deliberate law simplification, user call — the real award is
an indirect FK at the spot; the calm keeper reset is what the flag is
FOR here; 🚩 label kept). (3) "做一下观众席" → instanced crowd on every
terrace step (~300 bodies+heads, 2 draw calls, deterministic palette;
behind-goal stands stay LOW — failure mode 13). (4) "要增加传球力度吗"
→ measured: pass speed d·0.55+7.5 → d·0.6+8.2 (cap 22) — zip beats the
in-flight interceptors; completion 64→65-69%, interceptions 31→27,
t+i 57→49 (the smoothest the game has ever measured), goals 2.26 (≥2.2
holds; aimMargin has headroom if the user wants 2.5+ back). Fallout
absorbed: the 5v6 invariant moved to GOAL DIFFERENCE (the counter
economy keeps a besieged attack alive — the robust man-short cost is the
LEAK, 70 vs 59 conceded), the press/marking gene test went focused
(failure mode 15), the corner floor pooled over three seeds. 226 tests.

**Phase 31.7 — the cushioned trap (SHIPPED):** "长球停不住" — the 30.5
driven switch lands ~19.5 m/s, above CONTROL_MAX_SPEED 14, so it skipped
past the winger it was aimed at. The pass's INTENDED receiver may now
control up to 24 m/s (raised from a first cut of 22 when the user hit the
same wall on 40m keeper launches — "门将开长球穿模接不到"), priced by
attemptFirstTouch; bystanders/interceptors keep 14, so lane dynamics are
unchanged. LoftedPass completion 20-25% → 71%; goals 2.26 → ~2.5;
crosses recovered ~1.8-1.9 (switch receptions flow into wing play).

**Phase 31.8 — three live reports (SHIPPED):** (1) a held keeper ball
clears the BOX like a goal kick (user call — same calm-reset
simplification family as the offside goal kick). (2) "有的比赛还是到处抢"
— probed 112 matches: t+i variance 28–123 correlates ZERO with
press/aggression genomes; the top-5 chaotic fixtures were ALL
narrow-122 derbies (both attacks mirror into one corridor; the support
fan anchors to lanes and narrow lanes gave it no relief valve — worst:
224 passes, 123 turnovers, 0 goals). narrow-122's inside slots moved to
the HALF-SPACES (8/11 → 12/15; wide-212 stays ±19): worst-match t+i
123 → 97. The narrow derby remains the scrappiest fixture BY IDENTITY —
if play still reads too chaotic, the next dial is the founding share
(deriveTeamStyle attackingWidth threshold 0.5) or more half-space.
(3) the 5v6 invariant moved a THIRD time — to what survives n=60 across
economy tweaks: shots ratio < 0.97 + "never better off short" (the GD
penalty sank into ±8 pool noise; chasing it was testing noise, §10.5).
Final state: goals ~2.5, on-target 4.8, completion 69%, t+i 45 (the
ping-pong era is over: 57.5 at 30.5 → 45), tags `phase-31.6/7/8`, all
deployed, fingerprint `c5771aca…`.

**Phase 31.9 — four live reports + the headed-game pass (SHIPPED):**

(1) "门球时 mark 的球员往禁区里挤,抽搐" — steering fought Match's hard
box clamp every frame (drive in → teleport out). Fixed at the steering
layer: while a goal kick or keeper hold bars a player from the opposing
box, their target rides 0.4m OUTSIDE the clamp line, plus a velocity-level
backstop (separation between two markers on the edge shoved one inward)
and vel-braking on the hard clamps. Probed: pinned-on-clamp frames 4003 →
876 across 12 matches, longest streak 16 frames (was 79), zero above 0.5s.

(2) "门将扑救鬼畜,只有上半身动" — the dive pose tilted only the `lean`
group while the legs stood planted. PlayerModel grew a `body` group
(lean + legs, pivot at the feet); the dive is now a one-shot arc: whole
body tilts 1.2 rad with a launch hop, scissor legs, both arms to the ball
side, and a half-rate approach() recovery that reads as getting back up.
Render-only.

(3) "有没有一脚出球?" (user request) — a PRESSURED intended receiver
(opponent within 3.0+tempo·1.5m) now plays first-time: the reception opens
a 0.28s window + an immediate decision; any pass struck inside it carries
×(1.15 + (1−technique)·0.9) aim noise (loft range error too). Unpressured
receptions keep the 0.3s settle — the window must never be free or
one-touch ping-pong (the original disease) returns. ~12-16 one-touch
passes/match; completion 68→69%, tackles −1.3 (the pressured layoff
escapes the snap dispossession), t+i 49→43. tests/oneTouch.test.ts pins
the trigger, the consumption, and the technique-priced spray (measured
via release-angle std — completion in open scenes doesn't discriminate).

(4) **The headed-game pass** ("做头球那些") — the queue's marker REACTION
LAG shipped (markers tracking a >4.5 m/s mark within 26m of their own
goal re-read the stance target every 0.2–0.45s by `defending`, not
per-frame), but the probes showed it changed NOTHING — the corner was
being killed upstream by a chain of silent bugs the outcome metrics never
separated: (a) crashers pre-positioned ON the landing (a static box the
set marker always won) → the timed crash: hold 4.5m off the spot, burst
through it as the taker steps up; (b) the HAND-OFF GAP — the restart
clears ~0.2-0.5s before the kick, and licenses/routing/clearance all died
with it: crashers turned back toward formation spots mid-flight (fixed:
`team.cornerCrash` persists routine+personnel through the flight, brain
keeps MakeRun alive on it) and defenders rushed the taker so the launch
(first ~3m at leg height, inside the deflect window) was blocked at the
boot (fixed: the clearance circle now holds until the ball is actually
kicked, all restart kinds); (c) the corner cross led the target by
vel·flight ≈ 9m — a burst-timed crasher got the ball dropped far past
everyone (fixed: routine corners aim at the KEY ZONE, `performCross(at)`);
(d) **the 6m sentry** — our corner's apex is ~3.5m, so its ascent sits in
the header band until ~7.8m from the flag, and a defender camped on the
generic 6m clearance edge got a free header at every climbing corner
(fixed: `CORNER_CLEARANCE = 9.15`, the real law); (e) corner noise
scatters the landing ~2.6m σ — a crasher pinned to the table spot missed
half the drops (fixed: the closest licensed crasher re-routes to the true
descent, exact parabola, meeting 2.5m upstream where the ball crosses the
band). **Corner→shot 7.6% → ~24-35% pooled (aerial.test floor 0.04 →
0.08), headed goals ×3 (0.021 → 0.069/match), header shots 0.31 → 0.39.**

**31.9 finals (`calibrate -- 8`): goals 2.79, on-target 5.26, completion
69%, one-touch 11.7, crosses 2.08, t+i 43.2 (new low), offsides 1.68,
ball-in-play 91%. Fingerprint re-baselined `8a3a6534…`. 231 tests** (the
shootBias pool re-widened to 48 seeds and the finishing pool to 270 —
both were coin flips vs their real margins at the old sizes, §10.5).

**Phase 31.9.1 — the same-day live-play pass (SHIPPED):** four more
reports against the deployed 31.9.

(1) "抢断后球直接被对方控制,拦截/抢断/解围没区别" (user diagnosis of
乱抢) — dead right: the won-tackle "squirt" was cosmetic. Probed: **85%
of won tackles were re-captured BY THE TACKLER within 0.19s** (squirt
5.5-10 m/s < CONTROL_MAX 14, victim stunned 0.6s, tackler unrestricted).
Fix: the tackler is committed to the lunge — `kickCooldown 0.5` on the
win, so the loose ball belongs to the THIRD man. Now: tackler-himself
51%, victim's side recovers 25% (was 8%), mean loose-ball time 0.81s.
The three takeaways finally differ: interception = clean, tackle =
contested 50/50, clearance = hoofed hang (already healthy). Economy
fallout absorbed: goals 2.79 → ~2.5, completion 69 → 66% (contested
phases are back), ball-in-play 91 → 87% — if that reads too scrappy,
the tackler cooldown length is the dial.

(2) "门将手拿球/球门球时对方疯狂抽动逼抢" — the shape-wait re-arms the
hold in 0.25s quanta and the clearance DIED in the timer==0 gaps between
them: 22% of distribution time was gap, box intrusion ran 7× higher
there, opponents surged/expelled at ~4Hz. `gkDistributing` now spans the
whole hand-to-kick phase in stepBall's calm branch, the executor's
barred-box steering and assignChasers' zero-chaser rule — gap-frame box
intrusions: 123 → 0.

(3) "球员跑的时候帧率不对,眼花" — players hovering on the jog↔sprint
speed threshold (5.2, common now that marker-lag anchors jump their
targets) flipped limb swing amplitude 0.6↔1.05 INSTANTLY every few
frames — a strobe. Swing amplitude and arm factor now ease via
approach() like every rotation already did (render-only).

(4) "扑救动画后球的位置应该随手部变化" — the held ball hovered at the
standing carry spot while the body dove. ThreeMatchRenderer hands
BallModel a hands anchor (body-group localToWorld) whenever the owner's
body is tilted; the ball blends toward it by tilt fraction and eases
back as the keeper gets up (render-only).

Test pools re-powered while the economy moved (§10.5): keeper-reflexes
60 seeds (own pool — the 8-seed default gave the real +13pp save-rate
edge ~1σ), the 5v6 invariant 180 seeds with GD margin +12 (three
disjoint 60-pools measured GD-diff {+6,−17,−1}, σ≈12 — the old +4 margin
sat inside single-pool noise; the guard is for SYSTEMATIC inversions).
**31.9.1 finals: goals 2.48, on-target 4.51, completion 66%, one-touch
12.0, t+i 44.2, headers won 5.41. Fingerprint `6c963230…`. 231 tests.**

**Play-feel queue (post-31.9.1):** the box duel itself is now the header
bottleneck — defenders still win the first corner duel ~7:1 (the box
outnumbers the crash 4-5v3 and DF aerial sense 0.3 tops every crasher
role except ST 0.26). Next dials if the user still wants more headed
goals: rank crash-spot assignment by aerialSense (today it's player-index
order), a crasher momentum bonus in the duel score, or a longer reaction
lag. Also watch: kick protection changed restart dynamics for kick-ins
and goal kicks too (takers are no longer rushable in the hand-off gap) —
if restarts now feel too safe, the protection window is the dial. And
watch completion 66% + ball-in-play 87% (the tackle-scramble price) —
the tackler kickCooldown 0.5 is the dial if midfield reads scrappy again.

<details><summary>Original handover plan (done — kept for reference)</summary>

**Goal:** Phase 30 built the structure and honestly under-delivered on
scoring (~1.4 goals; target ≥2.2). The missing goals are chance VOLUME
against set shapes (on-target 3.45/match vs 29.2's 5.9 — per-shot
conversion is already back at 29.2 levels, don't re-tune it). This phase
gives attacks the real-football answers to a parked block, makes corners
real again, and lets formations evolve. **Read ARCHITECTURE failure modes
16–18 before writing any code.**

### Implementation order (the handover steps)

0. **Play-feel gate.** The first report came in texture-shaped and Phase
   30.5 (above) answered it. The gate now re-arms on the user's NEXT
   report: if the scramble/shape/wings complaints persist → iterate 30.5
   (the fan pull 0.75 / cap 0.9·radius, stance floor, duel cap are the
   dials); if it shifts to "还是进不了球/太干" → steps 1–2 are the phase.
   Do not skip this gate.
1. **Lane-aware shot selection + blocks.** Today `shotQuality`
   (mechanics.ts) is distance·angle·pressure — it cannot see the four
   parked bodies on the shot path, so carriers shoot into walls (and since
   30.4 shots are NOT leg-deflectable, those fly harmlessly). Build the
   pair together: (a) a `laneBlockers(pos, goal, opponents)` count —
   bodies within ~1m of the shot corridor's first 60% — that DISCOUNTS
   shot utility in `decideCarrier` (carriers work for an angle instead:
   the dribble/pass alternatives win when blocked) and (b) restore shot
   BLOCKS as an explicit mechanic (a blocker within the corridor rolls a
   block chance; blocked = loose ball, NOT the old speed-window deflection
   friction accident) so daring a blocked lane has a real cost. Net
   effect: fewer doomed shots, more shots from actual angles — volume AND
   conversion rise together. Directional test: shots taken with 0 lane
   blockers convert ≥2× shots taken with 2+.
2. **Cutback crosses + overload runs.** The byline cutback is football's
   canonical set-defence beater and the engine has every ingredient: a
   winger reaching the byline zone (localX > HALF_L−10, |y| > 12) gets a
   CUTBACK candidate — a hard low ball to the edge-of-box arc (localX
   ~HALF_L−16, |y| < 8) where a licensed late runner (MF/second WG —
   extend `assignRunners` with an `arriving` license) meets it first-time
   (the snap-decision reception in `giveBall` already exists). Second
   lever: when the ball is wide, the WEAK-side winger's attack spot pulls
   toward the far post (formationSpot override or a runner license) — the
   overload that punishes ball-side zone shifts. Directional: cutback
   goals exist (>0.05/match), crosses/match recovers toward ~2.5.
3. **Corner ROUTINES** (promoted from polish to fix — the one hardcoded
   cross died to set shapes: ~3% corner→shot, probed across three league
   seeds; the 29.1 crasher-momentum lever is INERT, the delivery dies
   before any aerial duel — so routines must create SEPARATION, not just
   aim elsewhere). `RestartState.routine`: near-post flick / far-post
   crash / short-corner give-and-go / edge-of-box cutback (reuses step
   2's arc mechanics), chosen by the taker's brain from openness of each
   routine's target zone; each routine = a target-spot table + which
   box-crash runners attack it (reuses the licensing). Tests: routine
   choice determinism; directional per routine (short completes more
   passes, far-post wins more headers); **corner→shot ≥8%** across league
   seeds (the plumbing floor in aerial.test.ts goes back up when this
   lands).
4. **Formations enter EVOLUTION.** Move style picks from
   "derived at creation" to franchise DNA: inherit on rebirth from the
   dominant parent, mutate with small per-season probability (~0.08 —
   switch ONE component to an adjacent option), log it as a lineage event
   (`🔧 switched to low-32`). Evolution tab: a stacked share-per-generation
   strip per formation id next to the gene sparklines. NOTE the zonal
   guard: zonal is the RARE identity by design (failure mode 18 — the
   lattice out-defends man); if evolution can mutate INTO zonal, keep its
   entry probability low or scoring sinks league-wide again. Tests:
   evolve-check shows a non-degenerate style distribution after 10
   seasons (nothing extinct, no monoculture).
5. **Retune + ship**: `npm run calibrate -- 8`; targets — goals ≥2.2
   (stretch 2.6), on-target ≥4.5, corner→shot ≥8%, offsides ~2–3,
   t+i stays ≤60, completion ≥62%. README/ARCHITECTURE stamps, tag
   `phase-31`, push (account switch!), verify Pages, remind itch.

### Risks / watchpoints

- Step 1's block mechanic re-opens the 30.4 hole if it uses the old
  speed-window deflection — implement it ON the pendingShot path,
  explicitly, or conversion silently dies again.
- Steps 1+2 both raise chance volume: calibrate between steps (at n=568)
  so step 5 isn't untangling a double overshoot.
- Formation mutation churn can destroy the identity continuity the
  dynasty timeline sells — keep mutation rare, one component at a time.
- The cutback runner license must respect the onside hold (executor
  clamp) — an "arriving" runner is exactly the profile the offside
  honesty gap flags; expect offsides to tick up and let them.

## ⭐ Phase 32 — free kicks become REAL — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome:** the danger-band FK (attacking half, 9–28m out) is a real set
piece: the SPECIALIST steps up (best finishing+technique·0.5 among
players within 26m — an unbounded pick summoned men who couldn't arrive
before the 6s failsafe), a 2–3 body WALL forms on the ball–goal line at
the law 9.15m (93% formed at kick in league play), the keeper cheats a
step to the near post, and the direct strike curls OVER the wall on a
closed-form parabola (z ≥ 2.6 at the wall — above the header band) and
dips. QUICK restarts (~7%) punish a slow defensive reset when a clearly
open FORWARD outlet exists. Fouls in the band are WHISTLED BACK
(⚠ deliberate narrowing of the 27.2 advantage rule — flagged for the
user's veto: the set piece out-values scrappy possession there; advantage
still swallows every whistle elsewhere), and the professional foul weighs
the new threat (willingness ×0.6 in range). League picture: ~0.7 danger
FKs/match, ~0.45 direct strikes, ~0.05 FK goals (the real game's rate —
the spec's 0.10-0.15 predates the advantage-rule reality), conversion
~8-10% focused. Fallout absorbed en route, each probed: the wall members
were glass-walled by the restart circle (exempted — the wall IS the
clearance), shoved off their slots by resolveOverlaps (1.1m spacing >
PLAYER_MIN_DIST), beaten to their line by the fast taker (the referee
now WAITS for the wall like corners wait for crashers), and — the best
one — released at the kick, they walked back toward their marks straight
into the climb's header band and free-headed the ball they had just
walled (the wall now HOLDS 0.7s after the strike). Calibrate: goals 2.66,
on-target 4.83, t+i 41.2, cards 0.94🟨 (the pro-foul discount), corners
still ~25%+ corner→shot. 238 tests (7 new in freekick.test.ts);
fingerprint `0782000e…`.

<details><summary>Original spec (done — kept for reference)</summary>

**Goal:** offside + professional fouls (29.x) made free kicks common; give
them teeth so the danger-band pro foul has real cost.

- **Build:** in `stepRestart`/`decideCarrier` for `freeKick` restarts
  within range (attacking-half, dGoal < ~28m): a DIRECT SHOT candidate
  (taker = best `finishing+technique·0.5`, override `pickTaker`), a 2–3
  man defensive WALL (defenders placed on the ball–goal line at the 6m
  clearance edge during setup — extend the clearance logic, they brace
  like the bubble), keeper cheats toward the near post. Direct FK shot
  uses `performShot` with a dedicated spread/power profile (curl over the
  wall: loft z that clears 1.8m at the wall and dips — the parabola
  machinery exists). QUICK restart option: if the taker reaches the spot
  in <1s and an open teammate exists, skip the min-setup once (cap: only
  when no wall has formed yet).
- **Tests:** wall forms (≥2 defenders within 1m of the ball–goal line at
  kick time for close FKs); direct FK conversion in a focused harness
  ~4–8%; quick-restart determinism.
- **Tune:** FK goals ~0.10–0.15/match; re-check pro-foul willingness (a
  REAL FK threat should make cynicism rarer in the danger band — consider
  feeding FK danger into the `tryTacticalFoul` willingness).
- **Risk:** wall clearance vs the existing 6m restart circle — don't let
  two clearance systems fight (the wall IS the clearance for close FKs).

</details>

## ⭐ Phase 32.1 — attack the drop — **SHIPPED**

"大脚高球也应该能被解围": nobody on the defending side ever attacked a
long ball's landing (nearest defender averaged 7.6m off the descent, 5%
aerial contests) — `interceptBall` has projected the parabola since
Phase 28, but chasers were picked by distance-to-BALL. The defending
chaser is now whoever reaches the LANDING fastest, scoped to long
(>12m) deliveries landing OUTSIDE our box — the unscoped first cut
attacked every cross/corner/chip too and cost 0.77 goals/match. A/B at
the 3-6m reachability band: defender clearances 21% → 29-44%; balls into
genuine space stay winnable (that's what the long ball is FOR).

## ⭐ Phase 32.2 — the ball-playing keeper — **SHIPPED**

User-approved design ("进球组织也可以门将一起参与…值得吗 → 开始"). The
BACK-PASS LAW: a deliberate teammate ball may not be picked up — the
keeper plays it at his FEET (pressable, no hold, no box clearance, no
calm reset; saves/claims/loose pickups keep the hands). Teammates price
him as a build-up OUTLET by `(passBias + riskTolerance)/2` × pressure —
the press-escape valve; the keeper's own feet-vs-hoof choice runs on the
same genes (clear ×(1.9 − (passBias+riskTolerance)·0.55)); keepers can
never Dribble (the 门将带球跑出禁区 class of nonsense is fenced for
good) and move a feet ball inside ~1.5s. `describeIdentity` gained the
**Ball-playing keeper** tag (>0.62) — an evolution identity you can SEE
in play. Probed: feet receptions 3.2/match (ball-play genome) vs
2.2 (hoofer); calibrate steady (goals ~2.5, t+i ~45). 241 tests
(gkBuildup.test.ts +3); fingerprint `c37f5020…`.

## ⭐ Phase 32.5 — evolution made VISIBLE — **SHIPPED**

The user's design question: "Evo 究竟指的是什么,是什么在进化?这个根本
不可视化". Both approved pieces built (UI-only, zero sim change):

1. **The REBIRTH CEREMONY** (`ui/RebirthCeremony.ts` + view-model
   `ui/rebirth.ts`): auto-shows at season end (game pauses, pause state
   restored on close; bulk sims show it ONCE at the end), reopenable from
   the Evolution tab. Elites crowned, style switches listed, and one card
   per death: 💀 old name → 🐣 successor, both parents with kit chips, a
   parent-vs-child GENE RADAR (dashed parents, filled child) with novel
   mutations highlighted (child genes outside BOTH parents' range —
   crossover can only produce in-range values, so out-of-range = genuine
   mutation, provably), and the inherited formation/scheme identity.
   evolve.ts now SNAPSHOTS parent/child genomes + dead name + inherited
   style into `EvolutionEntry` (records only — parents keep evolving, so
   live lookup would lie a season later; old saves fall back to live
   state).
2. **TACTICAL DNA CARDS + PRE-MATCH CLASH**: team cards swap the
   14-bar wall for a gene radar vs the dashed league mean (per-gene
   values in axis tooltips) + a 🌳 family-tree line (born-names
   reconstructed from the next rebirth's "was X" note). Every freshly
   loaded fixture opens with `ui/ClashBanner.ts`: both teams' radar +
   formation pair + scheme + identity tags side by side — a broadcast
   tale-of-the-tape, tap to dismiss, auto-clears once sim time passes 10s
   (never blocks play).

`geneRadar` joined `ui/charts.ts` (same dataviz rules; SVG overflow
visible so east/west axis labels don't clip). Gate: 249 vitest
(rebirth.test.ts +8), 2D suite 66 (+15: ceremony/clash/DNA + a 390px
phone section), 3D suite 36 (+2), phone overflow 0px. ⚠ Fingerprint
moved `c37f5020…` → `40f72c64…` — SCHEMA growth only: the fingerprint
hashes the save JSON, and the new snapshot fields live in
`history[].evolution.entries`. Proven sim-identical by stripping the
five new fields from the save and re-hashing → exactly `c37f5020…`
(technique worth remembering: record-only fields move the fingerprint
without moving the sim).

## ⭐ Phase 33 — the watching experience — **SHIPPED**

All three pieces, plus two live user requests:

- **Player RATINGS** (`sim/ratings.ts`, pure): 6.0–10.0, base 6.5 + goal
  1.2 / assist 0.8 / save 0.25 / recovery 0.1 / miscontrol −0.1 (now
  counted per player) / win +0.3, draw +0.1; written ONCE at the whistle
  into `playerStats[].rating` (probe: mean 7.09, min 6.3, max clamps 10).
  Live rating on the player card, `⭐ Man of the match` FT feed line,
  season SUM in playerAgg → `avgRating` per line → **🌟 Season MVP**
  award + hall-of-fame best-season-rating record.
- **TIKI-TAKA counter**: `Match.passChain` counts consecutive completed
  passes; `endPassMove(side)` finalizes on turnover, dead ball, shot,
  header or clear (mechanics call it so the 🎼 line lands BEFORE the GOAL
  line it produced). Threshold measured, not guessed: 6 ⇒ ~2.1
  lines/match, 8 ⇒ 0.75 → `PASS_MOVE_FEED_MIN = 6` (failure mode 7).
  `bestPassChain` per match → season `agg.longestChain` → season-report
  line + hall single-season record.
- **HT/FT auto-highlights** (`replay/highlights.ts` pure picker +
  GameApp reel): goals + big saves (newest goals survive the 4-cap),
  3s lead-in / 1.5s hold / 0.5× slow-mo, `cameraForEvent` framing, reel
  chip (`🎬 4' · 1/3`), ⏭ skips, presentation checkbox to turn off. HT
  reel = H1 moments; FT reel skips what HT already showed. 3D watched
  matches only; ceremony wins season-end conflicts; the pre-match clash
  hides during a reel and returns after.
- **User requests shipped live**: the SCOREBOARD (and the 3D/cinematic
  score bugs) is now a button — tap any time to pop the tactical-DNA
  clash, pinned until tapped closed; desktop CINEMATIC fit-contains the
  viewport (`min(100vw, 150vh)` — was stopping at the 960px natural
  width).
- **Fixed on the way**: `EventFeed.attach` now drains the outgoing
  match's unsynced tail (FT/MOTM/stoppage-goal lines used to VANISH when
  the next fixture attached in the same frame; a ⏭-skipped match's big
  tail collapses to its recap: goals + FT + MOTM).

Save v9 (rating/miscontrol/longestChain backfill). Gate: 267 vitest
(ratings +8, highlights +5), 2D 72 checks (+6), 3D 37 (+3, reel verified
then toggled off so later sections poll live play), fingerprint moved
`40f72c64…` → `183b9c55…` — record fields only, PROVEN by strip-and-rehash
back to exactly `40f72c64…`.

## ⭐ Phase 34 — the combination pack (套路包) — **SHIPPED**

User-requested ("2过1/三人轮转/套边这种小套路 → go"). Three explicit
patterns, built ONE AT A TIME, each probed for rate and guardrailed on
TWO calibrate seeds (goals 2.61/2.69 vs baseline 2.52/2.75 — neutral):

- **2过1 wall pass**: a short pass under pressure in the attacking half
  licenses the passer (`Player.wallRun`, partner-tagged) — a 1.2s BURST
  past his marker with a 2.3s return-credit window (the round trip alone
  is ~1.5s; the first cut's 1.15s license expired before any return
  could arrive, and a full-window sprint bled 0.3 goals/match of
  structure — dart, then re-join). The return INTO the burst (gain>0.2)
  flips the anti-ping-pong ×0.55 into ×(1.15+(tempo+passBias)·0.25).
  Gene-gated at 0.35: specialists ~0.6/match, slow sides exactly 0.
- **Third man**: a fresh receiver (<1.5s) bouncing it FORWARD to a
  running C (not back to A — that's the 2过1) gets ×(1+passBias·0.3~0.35)
  in both pass loops; flagged on `pendingPass.bounce`, credited on
  arrival. Possession sides ~5/match vs ~2 for direct ones.
- **套边 overlap**: a confronted wide carrier in the attacking half pulls
  a trailing same-wing teammate around the OUTSIDE (`team.overlapper`,
  executor routes past the ball down the touchline; the license
  SURVIVES its own release ball's flight — the 31.9 corner lesson,
  relearned). Release priced ×(1.3+width·0.6) only once the run has COME
  AROUND (bonusing him wherever he stood released central recycles
  wearing the overlap's name — probed, median reception |y| 9.6).
  Structurally rare in 6v6 (no wing-backs): WIDE ~0.13/match, narrow
  gene-gated to 0. Honest ceiling, documented.

Stats panel rows 2过1/三人配合/套边; directional tests per pattern
(combos.test.ts, side-balanced, deterministic-gate zeros asserted).
⚠ ECOLOGY WATCH: 3-seed evolve probe shows NO directional formation
bias (wide sweeps one seed, narrow another) but SHARPER selection —
2/3 seeds reached attack-formation monoculture by gen 10 (baseline
0/3, always ~8/8). Style mutation (0.08/season) is the re-entry
channel; revisit if the league gets STUCK. Fingerprint re-baselined
(behavioral): `183b9c55…` → `6f251a22…`.

## ⭐ Phase 34.1 — dive facing + the panel diet — **SHIPPED**

Two play reports, one sweep of UI calls:
- **GK 扑救后随球旋转**: the sim heading keeps tracking the ball and
  `setPose` applied it raw to a horizontal body — the dive now LOCKS the
  model's yaw at launch (`PlayerModel.yawLock`, render-only, fingerprint
  untouched `6f251a22…`) and eases back to the live heading (~0.45s) as
  he picks himself up.
- **Panel diet (user calls)**: the 2D/3D toggle is GONE (3D is the game;
  the Pixi view survives only as the WebGL-init fallback — suites reach
  it via `__evo.app.setViewMode`), Share summary deleted, CINEMATIC
  promoted to an always-visible stage button (🎥 top-right — it's used
  constantly; ✕/Esc exits as before), camera modes + FX quality became
  segmented controls, sound moved under 演出. Suites updated: 2D 75
  checks, 3D 37.

## ⭐ Phase 34.2 — the set keeper + the escape carry — **SHIPPED**

Two play reports:
- **"出手瞬间就做好扑救等球来"**: the ACTION-derived dive pose
  (GoalkeeperSave) rendered the full stretch from the strike. The
  keeper now holds a SET crouch (`gkReady`) until the ball is genuinely
  arriving — launch at ETA ≈ 0.38s (≈ the 0.32s stretch), computed from
  the ball's closing speed. Choreography only: `p.saving` (a real
  resolved dive) is never gated; fingerprint untouched by this half.
- **"球员不会向后带球" (脱压带球)**: a pressured carrier outside the
  final third with the front door closed used to stop dead (the forward
  dribble died to the pressure penalty) or drive into bodies. New
  `escapeCarry` predicate in perception.ts, shared by the SCORER (a
  Dribble candidate whose pressure penalty barely applies — escaping is
  the point; half-gated by dribbleBias, it's craft not flair) and the
  EXECUTOR (target = opponent-repulsion within 8m, tilted lateral so
  the carry arcs to the safe wing, never into the own box). Null when:
  front open (>0.55 space), final third (localX>15), pressure <0.45, or
  boxed in (<0.25 escape space) — the normal forward game is untouched
  (escape.test.ts pins all five cases). Calibrate both seeds in band
  (2.46 / 2.57); fingerprint re-baselined `6f251a22…` → `46c88002…`.

## ⭐ Phase 34.3 — orientation-aware receiving — **SHIPPED**

Two user reports ("脱压应配合角色: 中锋接球不转身护球/往后带, 边锋往边路带"
+ "球员朝向也挺重要"), three levers, all probed A/B vs phase-34.2
(scripts/probes/orientation-ab.ts, worktree method):

- **The TURN TAX**: driving forward with your back to the play is a
  contested touch — forward dribble × (1 − backToGoal·pressure·0.3).
  First cut at 0.4 dropped main-seed goals to 2.35 (below band); 0.3
  lands 2.53/2.62 on both seeds. Facing now shapes the decision: the
  back-to-goal receiver lays off first-time, holds, or escapes instead
  of auto-turning.
- **HoldUp zone** localX >0 → >−12: the target man shields wherever the
  ball finds him. ST hold-ups 0.16 → 0.50/match (3.1×).
- **Winger outward escape**: escapeCarry biases wide carriers (|y|>8) to
  THEIR touchline — mechanism probe: 374 wide escape frames, **100%
  outward, 0% inward** (guarded within 5m of the line where outward =
  into touch). Back-to-goal pressured retention 56.2% → 58.3%.

gkBuildup directional test n 40→80: the new outlets added variance to
keeper-reception counts and one n=40 sample landed 1.18× (bar 1.25×);
probed at n=80 the true ratio is 1.38× — scaled the test per §10.5, no
lever or bar touched. Fingerprint `46c88002…` → `e2e64942…`.

## The REALISM GAP plan (user-approved ranking 2026-07-13 — Phases 35–38)

The framing question was "离真实足球/实况还差哪些真正影响体验的 gap".
The coordinate: 实况's fidelity = thousands of mocap animations + control
feel — we never chase that. Our comparative advantage is the EVOLUTION
layer; gaps are ranked by watch-feel improvement per effort, not by
sim-parity. Agreed order: game-state tactics → visible touches → Magnus
curve → body contact. (Substitutions/bench: parked until after players-
become-PEOPLE — "people" first, then rotating them. Home crowd/audio,
text commentary with narrative memory, body-size-from-attributes,
injuries: parking lot below.)

## ⭐ Phase 35 — game-state tactics (比赛状态战术) — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome:** teams KNOW the score and the clock. `src/ai/mentality.ts`
is a pure function of (score diff, display minute, raw genes) served
through the `Team.genome` getter — every in-match gene read sees the
mentality-modified view (`effGenome`), the raw identity stays at
`info.genome` (style/evolution/UI untouched), and a LEVEL game returns
the raw object itself (bit-identity, pinned by test). Trailing from 68'
→ risk/tempo/press/depth float up **plus shootBias +0.25·u and width
+0.15·u**; leading from 72' → tempo −0.16·h, thin depth pull, corner
carry. Gene-modulated: the chaos side 梭哈 harder, the possession side
raises its passing tempo, a press identity keeps hunting even ahead.
The ramps start LATE on purpose — the first cut (60'/65') covered so
much of every decided match that league goals sank ~0.30 paired; at
68'/72' the paired 6-seed delta is −0.11±0.09 (noise-compatible) and
the drama concentrates in the true endgame.

- **The probe drove the shape** (mentality-ab.ts, n=600 pooled, two
  seed blocks vs phase-34.3 worktree — single blocks LIED, baseline
  comeback rate swung 10.6→5.3% between blocks): risk/press/depth alone
  sent trailing shot share DOWN (46.4→43.1%) — possession up, shots
  down, counters bled: through balls into a parked bus never work.
  shootBias/width fixed the direction; then the LEADER's bus at
  h·0.22 depth smothered comebacks below baseline, so the bus is THIN
  (h·0.12) and the shut-down is mostly CLOCK (tempo, keeper hold
  ×1.5, corner carry). Final pooled: trailing late shot share 44.6 →
  **47.7%** (+3.1pp), comeback rate 7.9 → **8.3%** (the spec's bounded
  lift), chase-conceded 0.208 → **0.237/game** (the chase COSTS),
  match goals flat (1.79 vs 1.77).
- **门将上前**: from 89' a trailing keeper supports sustained attacks
  from HALFWAY (chase positioning, executor), and an attacking corner
  licenses him into the box — the taker WAITS for the sprint (corner
  window extended to 8.5s, setpieces invariant updated), the license
  survives the hand-off + flight via `cornerCrash` (the 31.9 lesson),
  and dies within one brain tick after. 3/600 probe matches saw it;
  the debug seed produced a 90' keeper-up-corner equalizer. Feed lines
  (once each): `🧤 UP for the corner`, `⚡ throw everyone forward`,
  `🧊 shut up shop`.
- **The whistle never blows a set piece away** (refBlowsNow): awarded
  penalties/corners/walled FKs are PLAYED, and at patience-over a ball
  in flight still lands (the keeper-up corner was being cut at its
  climax — the exact class of the user's danger-band report). No
  keep-ball exploit: pendingPass clears on every reception and the
  whistle takes the gap.
- **打卡油角**: escapeCarry gained a `holdCorner` mode (leading late →
  the final-third gate opens, the carry blends toward the attacking
  corner, guarded off the lines) and HoldUp widens to ANY carrier at
  the flag; both scorer and executor read the same flag.
- **Free UI win:** the RightPanel gene bars read the live view — you
  can watch a trailing side's risk bar climb at 85'.
- Calibrate: main seed 2.47, cross-seed 2.40 (both in band); the REAL
  discovery is fm 18(b)'s new corollary — phase-34.3 ITSELF spans
  1.83–2.62 across 6 league seeds (mean 2.34), so behavioral levers are
  judged on PAIRED-seed means now, never one seed's band position.
  Fingerprint re-baselined (behavioral): `e2e64942…` → `3a5f659d…`.

## ⭐ Phase 36 — visible touches (可见的触球) — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome:** the magnet ball is dead. An outfield carrier DRIVING in
open field (nearest opponent > `TOUCH_CONTROL_DIST` 4.2m, moving
> 2.5 m/s, action Dribble) PUSHES the ball ahead along his heading
(`mechanics.performDribbleTouch`: base 1.2 + 0.3/m of open cone ahead,
technique prices length and wobble) and chases it — between touches the
ball is a FREE BODY. His `kickCooldown` (0.34s) is the poke window: an
opponent in the path plays the BALL. Close control (pressure, walking
pace, shielding, keepers, restart takers) keeps the old glue — the
tackle/shield duel economy lives there untouched. `touchTimer` at
capture (0.32 + low-tech 0.08) ≥ the decision settle, so the first
decision after any capture happens ON the ball: the pass game keeps
its timing, restart takers kick before a push can fire. Re-collects
are the same carry continuing: gentler first-touch roll (×0.45 — the
misalign term reads your own touch as blind-side), quicker next
decision (0.18s), no dribbles++ inflation. The 3D view needed ZERO
changes (adapter passes real ball pos; ownerGid null → it just rolls).

- **Probe drove the tune** (touch-rates.ts, n=150): first cut
  (3.5/1.7/0.38) rolled touches 1.09s and **39% were poked away** — a
  coin flip per carry; at 4.2/1.2/0.3 + the walking-pace glue gate:
  **18 pushes/match, flight 0.74s (spec's 0.5–0.8), mean gap 1.53m,
  poke 15.8%, recollect 79.9%**. Staged full-flow test showed the
  right emergence: a marked carrier GLUES and lays off (that's close
  control), so the poke test is unit-level on the push itself.
- **Economy held without re-tuning**: completion 68/69% (target
  66–68), t+i 43.5/38.4, fouls ~3.6-4.1, miscontrols +~2 (heavy
  touches are real). 6-seed paired calibrate vs phase-35: mean 2.165
  vs 2.228 — **Δ −0.06±0.10, noise-compatible** (the scary main-seed
  −0.48 was path divergence again; fm 18(b) discipline).
- Fingerprint re-baselined (behavioral): `3a5f659d…` → `2ada3cb1…`.

## ⭐ Phase 36.1 — carry regimes + the contested 50/50 — **SHIPPED**

Two same-day play reports on the touch game, one commit:

- **"跑动应该有不同的触球频率" (爆趟/一步一带/慢带):** the push range
  widened so the open cone ahead PRICES the touch — base 0.9 + 0.32/m
  (cap 9m), and the regather window follows the push (0.26 + 0.04·push):
  a knock is a chase, a dribble touch comes back within the stride;
  recollect settle 0.2s so 一步一带 chains. Probed regimes (touch-rates
  buckets): stride 41.5% of touches @0.43s/1.14m, mid 55% @1.05s/1.76m,
  knock 3.6% @3.56m mean gap. The first cut (slope 0.38/cooldown 0.06)
  overshot — pokes 26%, 13% of pushes rolled dead, goals −0.27 — pulled
  back plus a LINE GUARD (a knock that would roll into touch is halved;
  dead/expired 12.9→2.2%). Poke rate 16.4% (36's band held).
- **"有人去抢球,其他人呆住了" (36.2):** possession is STICKY, so after
  a squirt/miscontrol/knockdown the nominal owners never sent a body —
  `assignChasers` early-returned for the possession side and every 50/50
  was a one-team race. Now ONE nearest man contests a TRUE loose ball
  (owner null, no pass in flight, no dribble touch, no restart), with a
  ChaseBall candidate in the possession-side off-ball brain to consume
  it. Probed: possession side contests **100%** of ≥0.5s loose windows
  (~7/match; was structurally 0%).

Calibrate 2.13/2.55 (paired vs phase-39/40's 2.42/2.35 — mean Δ −0.05,
noise); fingerprint `608b4b4c…` → `b8fa54ae…` (behavioral).

## ⭐ Phase 37 — the curved ball (Magnus) — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome:** the banana ball exists. `Ball.spin` (rad/s) rotates the
free ball's velocity at a constant rate — a CIRCULAR ARC, so every
projection has an exact closed form. The two keystones:

- **Pre-compensation**: every curled kick launches rotated −spin·T/2,
  so the arc's CHORD still crosses where the straight aim pointed —
  the designed landing point is invariant by construction, and the
  probe proved it: corner descent→key-zone scatter 11.53m vs 11.95m
  on phase-36 (identically-biased sample of untouched deliveries —
  no regression). diveDifficulty prices the chord unchanged.
- **One flight projector**: the structure-pass's `ballLanding()` (and
  interceptBall's ground table) grew the arc form — chord = straight
  displacement rotated by half the turn. Every consumer (drop chasers,
  crash re-routes, GK claim) reads curved flight through them; all
  other consumers are frame-live (audited: attemptFirstTouch,
  tryKeeperSave, tryDeflection read instantaneous state;
  canInterceptPass only sees unspun ground passes).

Spin setters: crosses/corners inswing toward goal (0.28+tech·0.3,
sign = chord×toGoal); FK curls away from the keeper (0.25+tech·0.25 —
the first cut at ≤0.7 swung the climb past the wall's EDGE and 4/30
walls free-headed it, the exact 31.9 sentry failure; the solver now
buys +0.5m clearance per unit spin and the invariant test pins it);
placed shots bend away from the dive (0.1+tech·0.2, ground-plane spin,
travel time from the friction integral; dive difficulty ×(1−|spin|·0.12)).
Spin decays 0.25/s air, 1.5/s grass, ×0.55 per bounce; zeroed on every
plain kick and capture. The straight game is EXACTLY untouched (test:
spin 0 flies y===0).

Probes: analytic bow (chord·|spin₀|·T/8) on real corners mean 2.92m,
p90 4.66m — the visible whip. Calibrate 2.25/2.54 (paired vs 36:
+0.26/+0.17 — curled strikes buy goals back through the dive
discount). Fingerprint `2ada3cb1…` → `f6d49cda…`.

## ⭐ Phase 38 — body contact (身体对抗可视化) — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome:** the wrestle is legible — and it shipped as a PURE RENDER
phase: zero sim changes, fingerprint still `f6d49cda…` (proven by
re-run, the cheapest invariance proof a phase can have). Three contact
behaviors, all pure functions of RenderState (exported from
AnimationSystem, unit-tested + probed headlessly per invariant 11):

- **The shield** (new `shield` anim): HoldUp ON the ball, plus the
  pressured slow carry (`shielding()` — Phase 36 made the glued ball
  MEAN close control, so the body now shows the fight it implies):
  wide low base, backside into the man, fending arm barred, weight
  shifting foot to foot. 2.17s/match visible (was 0.15s with HoldUp
  alone — the action's 0.3s decision window is too brief to see).
- **The shoulder ride** (`rideSide()`, a lean layered ON the run
  cycle): both bodies within arm's reach at speed, near-parallel,
  BESIDE not in the wake, **and the ball in the duel** — that last
  gate is the discriminator that mattered: every marking pair on the
  pitch tracks at exactly PLAYER_MIN_DIST (the overlap resolver's
  shell), so without it the whole defense permanently leaned (probed
  185–286 bouts/match). Shipped: 33 bouts/match, 11.9s/match — a real
  duel every ~90s, brief.
- **The corner grapple** (`jostling()`): during a corner setup,
  near-stationary opponents in grabbing range in the goalmouth wrestle
  (braced arms, gid-offset sway so pairs never sync). 0.93
  player-seconds/match across ~3.2s of setups.
- The shove-stumble on fouls already existed (`stunned` → stumble).

Probe: `contact-choreo.ts` (headless RenderStates over 60 matches).
The user's phone verdict on how the poses READ is the open item.

## ⭐ Phase 39 — players become PEOPLE — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome:** six traits, DERIVED not stored (`evolution/traits.ts`, pure
fn of attrs+role, ≤2 per player, no save-schema change — developing
players grow into and out of them). Census (probe): 22.6% of newgens
carry one (0/1/2 = 77/20/3% — individuality, not soup), rising to 34.4%
by generation 8 as development pushes attrs over the bars (veterans
become 🛡️ enforcers and 🐱 cats). Every trait has a PLAY effect:

- 🎯 clinical (finishing ≥0.8, shooters): aimMargin −0.1, FLOORED at
  0.4 (the base formula's own minimum — an elite finisher who also
  shaved 0.1 aimed past the optimum and converted LESS; the finishing
  invariant test caught it)
- 🦊 poacher (ST, finishing ≥0.75, technique <0.6): runs attack the
  POST CHANNEL (|y|≈3.5) — a first cut narrowed him to the goalmouth
  center and his runs ended on the keeper's chest (fm 21, the goal-pull
  lesson; conversion DROPPED and the same invariant test flagged it)
- 🎩 playmaker (technique ≥0.8): pass-lane read ×1.15
- 🛡️ enforcer (defending ≥0.8): tackle +0.04, foul +0.02
- 🔋 engine (pace ≥0.82): stamina drain ×0.9 (cached on Player — no
  includes() in the physics step)
- 🐱 cat (GK, reflexes ≥0.85): keeper reach +0.12

Directional evidence by the DISCONTINUITY method (attrs 0.79 vs 0.81
across a bar — the step is the trait's own effect, §10.5): enforcer
p(win) 0.400→0.444 where the attr slope alone adds 0.005. Captains:
highest age·technique outfielder (`team.captain`), steadies TeamBrain's
mode hysteresis (±0.04) while on the pitch. Squad rows in the League
screen show trait emoji. Cut, per the anti-soup risk clause: season
stories (all six traits are visible IN PLAY) and the optional transfer
window (ecosystem isn't stale). Trait census probe = `trait-census.ts`.
Calibrate 2.42/2.35; fingerprint `f6d49cda…` → `608b4b4c…` (behavioral).

## ⭐ Phase 40 — league ecology — **SHIPPED**

**Outcome:** feuds and dynasties, both DERIVED from history (no save
schema beyond two optional slot fields on the playoff record — rivalries
live on the SLOT, the club that survives rebirths).

- **RIVALRIES** (`League.rivalryMeetings()`/`isDerby()`): every cup
  FINAL and promotion-playoff decider is a meeting; ≥2 meetings arm the
  pair forever. Armed fixtures play as derbies: `🔥 Derby!` banner,
  press appetite +0.04 both sides, foul bite +0.01 (`cfg.derby` →
  `match.derby`). Hall of fame lists armed pairs (宿敌对决). Census
  (probe, 3 seeds × 20 gens): 18–19 pairs MEET, **1–2 ARM** — a feud a
  decade, not one a season; 0–1 league derby fixtures per season (armed
  pairs don't always share a division — the cup rematch carries it).
- **PRESTIGE** (`League.prestigeOf()`): age-decayed trophy weight
  (title 1.0, cup 0.6, ×0.85/season; only slot-unambiguous honours).
  Bias: the D2 rebirth parent ranking adds `min(prestige,2)·0.03` —
  HARD-CAPPED at +0.06 on a ~0–1 fitness scale, so dynasties flip
  near-ties only. Gate held: champion churn 8–12 distinct in 20
  seasons (probe), evolve-check identity spread intact. Team cards
  show ★–★★★ from 0.5 prestige.
- Cut: H2H tables (per-fixture results aren't in history — a real
  schema cost for a table nobody asked for) and attendance flavor
  (parked with the crowd/audio lot).

Probe = `ecology-census.ts`; tests pin arming determinism, the banner,
the cap, decay math and long-run ledger determinism.

---

## Brainstorm parking lot (unscoped — pitch to the user before building)

- **Weather / pitch conditions** per fixture (seeded): rain raises
  first-touch difficulty + ball friction, wind perturbs lofted flight —
  deterministic modifiers, visible in 3D (particles) + a fixture badge.
- **Substitutions + bench + injuries** (realism-gap tier 2, deliberately
  parked until AFTER Phase 39 players-become-PEOPLE — "people" first,
  then rotating them): knocks from hard tackles, one sub per match,
  fresh-legs-at-70' drama; requires squad size 8 and is a data-model
  surgery. Evolution upside: bench depth becomes an evolvable asset.
- **Home crowd + reactive audio** (realism-gap tier 2): crowd noise
  swelling with xG moments, small home advantage; the audio bed is what
  the beeps can't fake.
- **Text commentary with narrative memory** (realism-gap tier 3): the
  feed upgraded to commentary lines that remember ("his third one-on-one
  miss this season") — the honest middle ground; voice commentary is
  实况's moat, never chase it.
- **Body size from attributes** (pairs with Phase 39): height/build
  mapped from attrs so the target man LOOKS like one.
- **Named managers**: a coach persona per franchise carrying the tactical
  identity across rebirths (the genome gets a face); cheap narrative win.
- **Season showpieces**: an All-Star match or Champion-vs-Cup-winner
  Super Cup as a season-end exhibition (standalone tie machinery exists).
- **Replay export/share**: serialize a match's seed+config into a shareable
  code — anyone can rewatch the exact match (determinism as a feature).
- **Commentary variety**: template pools for feed lines (seeded picks) so
  the feed reads less repetitive without translating sim text.
- **2D tactical minimap in 3D view** (picture-in-picture) for phone
  watchability.
- **11v11 / bigger pitch**: only after 6v6 + formations prove the
  structure scales; would need per-line formations and probably zones.
- **Perf**: gate the decision-tick `why`-string building behind a flag
  (largest remaining profile cost; results unaffected — mind
  watched ≡ skipped when wiring).
- **GLTF player models** with the procedural mesh as fallback.

**Ordering rationale (2026-07-13, realism-gap ranking):** 35 game-state
tactics is pure sim+genes with the highest drama-per-effort and the
strongest evolution synergy; 36 visible touches and 37 Magnus are "the
ball itself" — the visual foundation everything else reads against; 38
body contact depends on 36's touch windows. 39 PEOPLE + 40 ecology
follow (subs wait for PEOPLE). Each phase alone, probed (invariant 11),
one lever at a time.
