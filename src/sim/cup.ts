/**
 * The Evo Cup: a deterministic single-elimination knockout across both
 * divisions, woven between league rounds. Pure bracket logic lives here so
 * it is unit-testable; the League owns the state and the fixture scheduling.
 *
 * Rules (all deterministic, no live RNG state):
 *  - 16 entrants (all of Premier + Challenger), seeded 1–16 at draw time:
 *    Premier 1–8 by Elo, Challenger 9–16 by Elo. Higher number = underdog.
 *  - The R16 draw pairs every Premier side against a Challenger side
 *    (hash-shuffled), with Premier seeds placed so top seeds meet late.
 *  - The underdog hosts every tie — the cup loves an upset.
 *  - A DRAWN tie is decided by the league's cup draw mode (Phase 22):
 *    'shootout' (new-league default) runs a deterministic seeded penalty
 *    shootout — kicker finishing vs keeper reflexes, best-of-5 then sudden
 *    death — recorded on the tie as `shootout`; 'underdog' (and the
 *    shootout's 15-round failsafe) sends the LOWER-DIVISION (else
 *    lower-seeded) team through, surfaced via `byDrawRule`. No extra time
 *    either way — the match engine stays untouched.
 *  - Cup ties are standalone: no league table/Elo/season-stat/fitness
 *    bookkeeping (same pattern as the promotion playoff decider).
