/**
 * CB T0 — THE LAYER-1 CARRY-BEAT PHYSICS (docs/world-model/CB-T0-DORMANT-LAYER1-SEAM.md).
 *
 * Contract CB-CARRY-BEAT-CONTRACT.md §2 M-CB.1, dispatched by ruling #266.5. Two capabilities,
 * both DORMANT behind their own explicit flags (`cbCommitPhysics` / `cbTouchPast`):
 *
 *   (a) COMMITMENT-HONEST DISPOSSESSION — a challenge's outcome depends on the taker's own
 *       approach (speed, angle, momentum), and a beaten lunger pays the recovery interval HIS
 *       OWN motion model needs. Today's duel is GEOMETRY-BLIND (CB-C0: the take probability
 *       contains no taker-velocity term at all) and the miss price is a CONSTANT.
 *   (b) THE DIRECTIONAL TOUCH-PAST — the carrier knocks the ball a real distance into chosen
 *       space; the ball genuinely leaves his feet and the race is the engine's own loose-ball
 *       race. Whether a defender is BEATEN is decided by geometry alone — never a roll.
 *
 * ⭐ EPISTEMIC HONESTY, closed at the import list: this module imports the engine's own motion
 * and turf constants and NOTHING else. It cannot name `Match`, `Player`, `Team`, an rng, a
 * percept or a file path, so nothing here can read an opponent's internals or any census
 * artifact. Every body it is told about arrives as a plain kinematic record — the public facts
 * anyone on the pitch can see (where he is, how fast he is going, how hard he can accelerate).
 *
 * ⭐ EVERY CONSTANT TRACES (#200). The only numerals below are (i) `0`, (ii) the arithmetic of
 * the closed forms themselves — the `2` of `v²/2a`, the `1` of `1 − e^{−kt}` — which are
 * algebra, shown in place, not chosen values, and (iii) `touchPastPush`, which is the ENGINE'S
 * OWN push law reproduced verbatim from `performDribbleTouch` (Phase 36/36.1) so that a
 * touch-past is the carry regime the engine already has, aimed — G-TRACE reads that expression
 * back out of `mechanics.ts` and asserts it. Nothing here is tuned and nothing is imported from
 * a census.

 * ⭐⭐ THE ONE PRIMITIVE — REACHABILITY SLACK, in metres.

 * A body carries his current velocity (he cannot teleport it away) and may add at most `a·t` of
 * velocity change over `t`, so the set of points his own motion model can put him on at time t
 * is the disc centred on his BALLISTIC drift `pos + vel·t` of radius `½·a·t²`. The target drifts
 * too (a carried ball rides at the carrier's velocity — `stepBall` writes `ball.vel = owner.vel`
 * — so a first-order projection of the target is a projection of the CARRIER's motion).
 *
 * The slack at time t is how many metres of that disc are to spare:
 *
 *     slack(t) = ½·a·t²  −  | (target + targetVel·t) − (pos + vel·t) |
 *
 * and the body can be ON the target at some point inside his own horizon iff the slack is ever
 * non-negative there. The returned value is the BEST slack over the horizon, sampled on the
 * engine's own timestep DT (the grid the world itself is integrated on).
 *
 * This single number carries speed, angle and momentum at once: a defender flying past is
 * carried out of the disc by his own `vel·t`; a defender who has planted can spend the whole
 * disc on the ball; a defender in the carrier's path meets a shrinking gap while one chasing
 * from behind meets a constant or growing one. It is not a distance test — two bodies at the
 * same distance with different velocities get different answers, which is the whole point.
