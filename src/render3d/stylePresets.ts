/**
 * Track F / F0 — the style-direction showcase, as DATA.
 *
 * F0's question is "what should this game look like", and it is answered by
 * the user's eyes, not a probe. So the three candidate directions live here as
 * plain preset objects that `createScene`, `createPitch`, `PlayerModel` and the
 * renderer read. Nothing here touches the sim; every value is a colour, a
 * light, a material flag or a canvas-painting parameter.
 *
 * The arms (F0 row, trimmed on the user's call 2026-07-25 — the
 * broadcast-realism arm was dropped rather than built: it needs gLTF rigs and
 * skeletal animation, which contradicts ART_DIRECTION's procedural-first rule,
 * and the user's reference image is stylised, not realist):
 *
 * - `current`    the baseline, byte-for-byte today's look. The control.
 * - `coherence`  same palette, one material language: ACES tone mapping and a
 *                managed exposure, unified atmosphere, crisper turf grain.
 *                Answers "how much of the gap is just incoherence?"
 * - `toy`        the toy/board-game direction: toon ramp shading, flat vivid
 *                palette, groomed-and-WORN turf, softer paint, warmer key.
 *
 * Lighting is ORTHOGONAL to the arm (user 2026-07-25: "白天也做一版给我挑").
 * `night` reproduces the committed floodlit diorama; `day` is the open
 * question against ART_DIRECTION's "atmosphere darker than the surface" rule.
