 * which are the same box-person skeleton in their own files. They share the
 * constant because they share a world: shrinking players alone would leave
 * the officials towering over them.
 *
 * What does NOT move (the user's rule): name labels, selection rings and
 * halos keep full size — they are information, not anatomy. Nor does any sim
 * constant: this is render-only, so the fingerprint cannot move.
 *

 * the nearest 0.01 so the anchor holds for every role at the tallest identity

 * RB (round body, 2026-08-19) — the user's directive: 「我觉得球员现在方形身体
 * 一有点违和,也不符合实际模型,应该变成身体变圆(类似于现实)」. Every anatomy
 * box became a BODY OF REVOLUTION: no vertical edge survives anywhere on the
 * man. The primitive is `barrel()` — a lathed rounded rectangle: circular in
 * cross-section, straight-sided through the middle, rounded off at both ends.
 * A full capsule (corner radius = half-width) was tried first and read as a
 * BALL: the chest lost its shoulder line and the short upper arm turned into
 * a bead. Keeping the corner radius BELOW the half-width restores the
 * shoulder/hip lines while the silhouette stays round from every angle.
 *
 * THE INVARIANTS THIS SLICE KEEPS, by construction (nothing else may move):
 *  - Every part occupies the SAME bounding box as the box it replaces (a
 *    capsule's total height = length + 2·radius; the radii ARE the old box
 *    half-widths, so `armSpan`/`maxArmSpan` and the F1 anchor 0.64 are
 *    numerically untouched, and the F2 toy proportions read the same).
 *  - Non-circular cross-sections are baked into the GEOMETRY (`.scale(1,1,k)`
 *    at build time), never onto the mesh — `mesh.scale` still carries role
 *    build × per-player bulk exactly as before.
 *  - Every pivot and every translate-to-pivot offset is byte-identical, so
 *    the elbow group (y=-0.34) and knee group (y=-0.55) still hold and
 *    AnimationSystem's poses are unchanged.
 * Segment counts are deliberately low (corners 3, radial 8–12): this game has
 * a live perf budget and the silhouette, not the shading, is what reads.
