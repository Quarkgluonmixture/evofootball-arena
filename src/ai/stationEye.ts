// Contract: docs/world-model/STAGE3-P2-DORMANT-EYE.md §2.3-§2.5, as amended by
// commander ruling #43.3.
//
// A body at a decision instant prices the SAME 18-candidate ball-local lattice
// P1R censused, reading his OWN percept for the context and the committed
// approach table for the value, and commits his window to the best-priced
// approach — or to the incumbent, which is the table's own control arm and is
// therefore a first-class choice rather than a fallback.
//
// The table's meaning is ruling #41.2's and no other: the signed value of
// committing W to APPROACHING candidate X. Nothing here reads "standing".
//
// PURE. No world mutation, no RNG, no truth lookups except in the ORACLE-CTX
// arm, which is a probe-only diagnostic (contract §2.5) and never reachable
// from a production path.

// V3-P1 built a role-conditioned table: each context carries a per-ROLE column
// (DF/MF/WG/ST), each column an 18-candidate approach value keyed on the TRUE
// role of the forced body. The V3-P2 chooser is strictly SIMPLER than v2's: each
// body reads HIS OWN role's column — role is the world's own immutable own-state
// (`Player.role`, read never authored, A4-honoured trivially, no percept) — and
// argmaxes the value advantage vs the incumbent control recovered per
// (context × role). There is NO going-bit (#77.2(ii): the going axis is out of the
// v3 table), so the only perceived feature is the CONTEXT (face/third/density), as
// in v1. A DF and an ST at the same moment read DIFFERENT columns and argmax to
// different candidates BY CONSTRUCTION. Nothing here is reachable from a production
// path; the eye is null in the shipped game; the table + control are INJECTED by
// the probe, never bundled in `src/**`.
