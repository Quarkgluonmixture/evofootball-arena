// PTP T0 — THE PASS-LEAD SEAM (docs/world-model/PTP-T0-DORMANT-SEAM.md).
// Contract: docs/world-model/PASS-TO-PATH-CONTRACT.md §2 M-PTP.1–4. Ruling #231.
//
// 传球到路: the carrier's pass model gains SIGHT of a SUPPORT-mode receiver's motion.
// The ordinary pass loop has always priced every support receiver AT HIS FEET; the
// through-ball loop alone leads a body, and only a LICENSED `MakeRun` runner. This
// seat extends that same lead arithmetic — the through-ball family's own, traced,
// never re-derived — to the ordinary loop's support mates, weighted by ONE gene.
//
//   aim = mate.pos + passLeadSupport · projectedDisplacement(mate, flight)
//
// NO PREDICATES (#200): the lead is unconditional geometry × gene. A STILL mate's
// projected displacement is zero, so his aim point IS his feet — to-feet EMERGES, it
// is never branched on. The complete conditional set of this file is GATE (the slice
// scope: support mode; the flag, read by the single caller), GUARD (the finite/absent
// checks and the "did I see him at all" zero) and ZERO (born-absent ⇒ 0).
//
// ⭐ INFORMATION HONESTY IS THE HARD RULE OF THIS FILE (contract M-PTP.1, VISION §1
// 感知诚实). The MOTION the projection consumes is the motion THAT WORLD'S CHOOSER
// can honestly have:
//   * bare world (`edsPerceivedChoice` false) — the pass loop prices truth positions,
//     so the motion is truth velocity: the SAME source, no new channel;
//   * percept world (`edsPerceivedChoice` true) — the chooser swaps onto this body's
//     own perceived snapshot, so the motion is the REMEMBERED velocity of that mate
//     in that snapshot (`ObservedPlayer.vel`, recorded at `observedTick`, stale by
//     `ageTicks`). A mate he has not seen has NO motion for him: zero ⇒ to feet.
// `perceivedSnapshot` is the ONLY member of `match` this module touches, and the
// world shape is handed IN by the caller (never read off `match` here), the OBM-T0
// `ctbPlaneArmed` precedent — so the source pin is machine-checkable (G-EPI-MOTION in
// the probe and in `tests/ptpPassLead.test.ts`).
//
// ⚠ THE ANCHOR STAYS THE INCUMBENT'S (an honesty limit, stated not hidden). The BASE
// of the aim point is `mate.pos` — TRUTH — in BOTH world shapes, because that is what
// the ordinary pass loop has always priced and because the zero-point identity
// requires it (`x + 0 === x`). This slice adds a MOTION channel, and that channel is
// world-appropriate; it does NOT re-anchor the incumbent's position channel, which is
// a separate (and much larger) question that belongs to the percept trunk, not here.
//
// Dormant: `ptpPassLead` is a hard `false` in every production path, so nothing in
// this file is reached in the shipped game.

/**
 * ⭐ THE FROZEN FLIGHT-TIME SPEED (M-PTP.1, "flightTime … reuse the through-ball
 * family's own traced arithmetic … no new constants").
 *
 * TRACED, NOT INVENTED. `18` is the THROUGH-BALL LOOP'S OWN flight-time divisor — the
 * one number the lead-pricing family already uses to turn a pass distance into a
 * travel time, in `src/ai/PlayerBrain.ts`'s through-ball loop:
 * `const flight = dist(p.pos, mate.pos) / 18;`
 * This seat asks the through-ball's question of a support mate ("how long is the ball
 * in the air on the way to him"), so the family member is chosen by QUESTION IDENTITY:
 * the ordinary-loop `18` that already prices a LED pass, not `performPass`'s executed
 * `16 · powerMul` (which is a specific body's orientation and chosen weight — the
 * chooser does not know it while scoring) and not `MARK_SAG_BALL_SPEED`'s access-time
 * account. The source line is asserted VERBATIM by the probe and the test, so the
 * family cannot drift.
 *
 * Never re-cut: if PTP-T1 needs a different speed that is a fork for the commander
 * WITH numbers, not a quiet re-freeze after sight.

 * receiver over a flight of `flight` seconds"*, in `src/ai/formations.ts`:
 * `return v2(p.pos.x + p.vel.x * flight * 1.6, p.pos.y + p.vel.y * flight * 1.6);`
 * That IS the projection this slice extends from licensed runners to support mates,
 * so it is taken whole rather than re-derived. (For the record, the rest of the
 * family: `performPass`'s EXECUTION lead is `mate.vel · flight · 0.8` — a strike-time
 * correction on the incumbent's own flight estimate, not a chooser's projection; and
 * `runBurstPoint`'s standing-runner branch projects along the RUN TARGET, which is a

 * and every other action type is out of slice one. This is a scope gate on WHO this
 * limb is about, NOT a predicate on a continuous feature: nothing here asks whether
 * the mate is moving, checking, fast or free.

 * `x`. That is what G-ZERO measures rather than asserts.

 * NO CAP is taken at T0, and that is a decision, not an omission: the displacement is
 * bounded BY CONSTRUCTION (|motion| ≤ a body's top speed, flight ≤ the loop's own
 * long-ball distance / 18, gene ≤ 1), and the pricing is evaluated AT the led point —
 * so a lead too greedy to be a real pass prices ITSELF out through lane/open/gain
 * rather than through an engineer's ceiling. Any cap is a T1 fork WITH numbers.

 * PURE: no rng, no writes, no truth in a percept world.
