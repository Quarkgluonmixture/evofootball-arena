// DV T0 — THE DORMANT RISK-PRICING SEAM (docs/world-model/DV-T0-DORMANT-SEAM.md).
// Contract: docs/world-model/DELIVERY-VALUE-CONTRACT.md §2 M-DV.1 / M-DV.2 (as amended by
// ruling #247) / M-DV.3. Rulings #245 (the map-vs-reality audit), #246 (method reality's,
// numbers this world's, SHAPE the fidelity check), #247 (⭐⭐ TRUTH vs BELIEF), #248 (the
// earned-knowledge ledger — this is the PILOT), #249 (DV-C0 banked, DV-T0 queued).
//
// 出球价值: the delivery pricer's map has two holes the #244 arc named. This seam adds the
// RISK limbs and nothing else:
//
//   (1) FLIGHT EXPOSURE (M-DV.1) — "can this be cut out ON THE WAY", a continuous hazard
//       over the ball's own travel, computed from the SAME opponent-position source the
//       pricer's corridor read already consumes. It is the corridor read MADE
//       TIME-AWARE: `laneOpenness`'s own geometry with the opponent's own closing
//       capability over the flight subtracted from the distance he still lacks.
//   (2) THE LOSS-COST BELIEF (M-DV.2 as amended by #247) — "what would losing it THERE
//       cost me", read as THREE evolvable per-zone weights applied to the candidate's
//       RECEPTION zone.
//
// ⭐⭐ THE #247 TRUTH/BELIEF SPLIT IS THE LAW OF THIS FILE, and it is structural, not a
// promise. THE TRUE TABLE — DV-C0's census-measured turnover→goal-against hazard, which
// lives in that stage's committed artifact — is INSTRUMENT-SIDE. It is not imported
// here, not typed here, and neither its file name nor any of its values appears anywhere
// in `src/**` (G-NOTABLE greps the whole tree for exactly that, on the artifact's own
// numbers rather than on a copy). What this file owns is the player's BELIEF: three
// weights BORN ABSENT, which a team can only ever acquire by evolving them. A wrong
// belief is legal and is STYLE. The census's ZONING is imported (the boundary is
// `HALF_L / 3`, re-derived from the pitch's own constant below) — the zoning is the
// STRUCTURE of the question, and per #248.1 structural dimensions may be hand-built; the
// ANSWERS (the hazards) are what must be earned.
//
// ⭐ NO NEW CHANNEL (M-DV §6 感知诚实). This module takes `opponents` — the very array
// `laneOpenness(p.pos, aim, opp.players)` is already called with one statement earlier —
// and `Player.topSpeed`, a body's knowledge of its own physics (#248.1: legitimately
// innate). It does not take `Match` at all, so it CANNOT read a percept snapshot, a
// truth channel or anything else: the epistemic pin is that the module's import list and
// its signature make the wider world unreachable. The DV term is therefore exactly as
// honest — no more, no less — as the corridor read it extends.
//
// ⭐ NO PREDICATES (#200). Both limbs are continuous and unconditional. The complete
// conditional set of this file is GATE (the arming rule), GUARD (`sentOff` and the
// clear-the-kicker radius, both inherited VERBATIM from `laneOpenness`), ZONE (the
// census's frozen three-way classifier — a SELECTOR that decides which evolvable weight
// is read, never whether an action happens) and the running max's comparison, which is
// `laneOpenness`'s own aggregation written as a max instead of a min.
//
// Dormant: `dvDeliveryValue` is a hard `false` in every production path, so nothing in
// this file is reached in the shipped game.

 *     SKIP    if dist(cp, from) < DV_CLEAR_RADIUS          [laneOpenness's own guard]

 *     e(o)  = 1 − clamp01(lack / DV_CORRIDOR_SCALE)        [laneOpenness's own scale]
 *   with exposure = 0 when no opponent contributes.
 * ```
 *
 * ⭐ WHY THIS FORM AND NOT A SAMPLED INTEGRAL (declared sharpening — the contract says
 * "integrated over the ball's own travel" and is silent on the quadrature). A sampled
 * integral needs a SAMPLE COUNT, which would be an invented constant, and it needs a
 * per-sample kernel, which would be a second invented shape. The closest-approach point
 * is where the corridor family ALREADY evaluates a defender against a lane — it is the
 * point that maximises his chance over the whole segment for a straight-line closer — so
 * this form is the same integral's arg-max taken exactly, at zero new constants. The
 * aggregation over bodies is `laneOpenness`'s own (`worst = min`, here written as a
 * running max because exposure is openness's complement), so a lane's exposure is set by
 * its most dangerous body exactly as its openness is set by its nearest one.
 *
 * ⭐ IT DEGENERATES ONTO TODAY'S CORRIDOR READ, which is what makes it a SHARPENING and
 * not a new sense: at `topSpeed = 0` (or `t = 0`) the expression is
 * `1 − clamp01(d / 4)` — precisely `1 −` the term `laneOpenness` contributes for that
 * body. Everything the limb adds is the metres he can cover WHILE THE BALL FLIES.
 *
 * ⚠ HONEST LIMIT (stated, not hidden): the closing model is `topSpeed · t` — a body's own
 * top speed times the flight, with no acceleration, no reaction delay and no facing. It
 * is deliberately the CHEAPEST capability that is still time-aware; the engine's richer
 * `estimateReach` account belongs to the observer instruments (it needs a reach profile
 * and a percept snapshot), and importing it here would be a new channel. So this limb
 * OVERSTATES a stationary defender's closing and understates nothing.
