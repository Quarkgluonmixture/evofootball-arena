// at 1.000000 exactly), and the only latency the world does pay is one flat event-BLIND
// cadence constant (99.2 % of all `decisionTimer` re-arms). This module is the CAPACITY for a
// body to be SURPRISED — to keep running his stale plan for a tier of processing time he pays
// per situation class, short where his own book covers it and long where it does not.
//
// ⭐⭐ IT GENERALISES A SHIPPED IDIOM, IT DOES NOT INVENT ONE (#297 item 3). `markAnchor`
// (actionExecutor.ts, the Phase-31.9 marker reaction lag) already freezes a steering target and
// re-reads it on `lag = 0.45 − defending·0.25` ∈ [0.20, 0.45] sim-s. The move here is from
// (sprinting mark ∧ near own goal ∧ attribute-keyed) to (any surprise class ∧ BOOK-keyed).

// ⭐ EPISTEMIC HONESTY, closed at the IMPORT LIST (the `defenceBook.ts` form): this module
// imports the engine's own tick constant and NOTHING else. It cannot name `Match`, `Player`,
// `Team`, a percept snapshot, an rng or any census artifact. Everything it is told arrives as
// PRIMITIVE NUMBERS AND STRINGS from its caller (`Match.pcLatencyObserve`, the one detector).
//
// ⭐ THERE IS NO GENE. This seam writes no genome field, adds no `GENE_KEYS` entry and
// serializes nothing, so it has no Lamarck surface at all (#270: nothing in `info.genome`).
//
// Dormant: `pcReactionLatency` is hard `false` in every production path, so no instance of
// anything in this file exists in the shipped game.
